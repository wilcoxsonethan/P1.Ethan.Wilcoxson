    <h1>Project 1 - Ethan Wilcoxson</h1>
    <p> This elevator interface is one of the elevators in the MCM Elegant√© Hotel
    </p>
    <img src = "panelon.jpg"
        width = "300"
        height = "400"/>
    <img src = "paneloff.jpg"
        width = "300"
        height = "400"/>

    <p>There are many problems with this interface, the first is the fact the buttons
        aren't arranged vertically and when the buttons are lit, you are unable to
        see the floor number or what the function of the button is. Below my sketch
        solves these issues by removing the label from the button and putting it next
        to the button and reposition the floor numbers, so the higher floor is at the 
        top of the button stack.
    </p>
    <img src = "sketch.jpg"
    width = "500"
    height = "500"/>
    <p> My sketch demostrates that I made the commonly used buttons
        more easy to idenitfy and easier to use. Moving the floors into a
        vertical orientation allows for the user to more quickly identify
        which button to click to go to their desired floor. The door open and door closed
        buttons are at the top of the panel allowing for easy use and identification.
