    <h1>Project 1 - Ethan Wilcoxson</h1>
    <p> This elevator interface is one of the elevators in the MCM Elegant√© Hotel
    </p>
    <img src = "panelon.jpg"
        width = "300"
        height = "400"/>
    <img src = "paneloff.jpg"
        width = "300"
        height = "400"/>

    <p>There are many problems with this interface, the first is the fact the buttons
        aren't arranged vertically and when the buttons are lit, you are unable to
        see the floor number or what the function of the button is. Below my sketch
        solves these issues by removing the label from the button and putting it next
        to the button and reposition the floor numbers, so the higher floor is at the 
        top of the button stack.
    </p>
    <img src = "sketch.jpg"
    width = "500"
    height = "500"/>
    <p> My sketch demostrates that I made the commonly used buttons
        more easy to idenitfy and easier to use. Moving the floors into a
        vertical orientation allows for the user to more quickly identify
        which button to click to go to their desired floor. The door open and door closed
        buttons are at the top of the panel allowing for easy use and identification.
    </p>
    <img src = "panel.gif"
    width = "800"
    height = "450"/>
    <p> This design allows the user to complete common actions with ease. A typical action would
        be to step into the elevator and click the button for the floor you wish to go to. My design
        allows for the user to easily identify which button to click to go to the floor they want to
        go to and it provides feedback after the button is clicked so the user can confirm that they
        selected the correct floor and their input was received. Additionally, my design only uses
        numbers and symbols so whether or not the user understands English, the panel is able to be
        used easily.
