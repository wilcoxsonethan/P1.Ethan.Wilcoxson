    <p>There are many problems with this interface, the first is the fact the buttons
        aren't arranged vertically and when the buttons are lit, you are unable to
        see the floor number or what the function of the button is. Below my sketch
        solves these issues by removing the label from the button and putting it next
        to the button and reposition the floor numbers, so the higher floor is at the 
        top of the button stack.
